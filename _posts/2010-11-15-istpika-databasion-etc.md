__15 Nov 2010 - Osaka, Japan__

My apologies to anyone visiting my site looking for MongoDB/Cucumber posts.  The data was almost a year old and irrelevant, so I have taken them down.  Their contents can still be viewed via my [github respository](https://github.com/boj/boj.github.com) should anyone still be interested.

Ideally I want to begin posting about my work at [Istpika](http://www.istpika.com/), my [databasion tool](https://github.com/boj/databasion), and any other technological things I am doing on the side.  It's difficult to really sit down and focus on writing anything specific, but hopefully something will emerge!

On top of blog posts, I also plan on creating a web page for databasion to give it more of an accessible frontend.  I'm still not sure who is actually using it, but there's been roughly [1350 downloads](https://rubygems.org/gems/databasion) to date which is surprising to me.  Thanks to everyone actually using my project.  If you have time please give me a shout on [twitter](http://twitter.com/mojobojo).
